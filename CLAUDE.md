im trying to setup a claude code workflow to satisfy:

im still trying to figure out what agents/ working claude panes work best (need to review best practices) regardless of the how i do want: 

- stack-1: automatic linting across the project
- stack-2: automatic testing of examples across the project (nginx, docker compose, dockerfile)
- stack-3: automatic clark idiomatic style formatting (no emojis, concise readmes, use uv, use bun)
- stack-4: automatic/manual git commands with claude (auto subtree services)
- stack-5: ci/cd workflows for git
- stack-6: automatic design doc generation and update into google drive for collaborators (i.e. docs/ -> $googledrive/design/date/{files})
- stack-0?: global router claude workflow for grabbing the stacks i need
- stack-7: atomatic db setup, knows how to read docekr compose and edit the mcps of each relevant claude to use the correct database urls

help me come with ways to formalize this into a real workflow. stacks can probably be a single agent, but i assume there is some way to do it better. maybe like

agent: stack router uses github/csaben to checkout csaben/claude-stacks/stack-1 which maybe contains a CLAUDE.md + ./claude/agents/*.md + misc + .local-settings.json for claude to know which mcps it has permissions to use to minimize need to approve stuff

then in that pane spins those up.

but maybe there is a better way or a way to also add in the idea of checking out multiple things in the repo as described here [https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows)

ultimately being able to do something like this would be cool:

example:

"we would like to get our stack to the point that if i walk into the resoul repo i can just say
"apply {change}. use all necessary stacks "
change: update repo to work with fichub. it already can but has issues with weird characters (latin?). ensure it works by testing with "purple days" on fichub
stacks: linting, example-generation, clark-idiomatic-styling(maybe just CLAUDE.md), checkout workflows as needed from csaben, update docs/ and on final push create and store a design store on googledrive"

i really enjoy the idea that this could be setup in a way that im like

open terminal navigate to workspace folder or open tmux run this workflow and the claude code setup spin up tmux panes per stack me go into the tmux session and be able to view the workers and approve as needed



## Style
- no emojis
- use bun for typscript
- use uv for python (uv python subagent)
- commit messages should exclude "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
